A simple OpenGL based 2-dimensional drawing viewer

Accepts a (static) list of drawing primitives and renders them in
a window.  Allows view changes via mouse and keyboard control.

Drawing primitives: line, point, rectangle, circle, arc, triangle, text, image
Drawing modifiers: color, fill, wire, width, layer

Coordinates allowed are +/- 2000000000 (roughly a 32-bit signed integer)
